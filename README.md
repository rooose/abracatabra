# AbraCATabra ðŸ˜»

Abracatabra is a mobile app to help bring stray/lost cats back home.

## Cataset

We are currently building a dataset using crowdsourcing. The dataset is build of multiple pictures of a same cat for multiple cats, in order to build a model that can identify if a cat is the same on two different pictures. Once the dataset is cleaned up, we will make the data available for everyone to build their own apps and cool projects :)

## Contribute

Send your cat pictures at rosecataset@gmail.com
What we're looking for:

- Two or more pictures of the same cat, ideally being the only cat in the picture
- The cat should be recognizable between the pictures (ex: before/after pictures and kitten/adult pictures are no good because it is way harder to recognize the cat, even for a human - AI is smart, but not THAT smart)
- It is totally fine (even better) if there is a difference in lighting, environment or zoom between the two pictures ðŸ™‚

We are also currently working on project roadmap for the development of the mobile app. If you are a developer, make sure to keep checking the repo for updates! If you have any other skill that you think would be useful, don't hesitate to reach out!
